            Not a lot of competition in the world of fan pages I guess. I just want this to be a focused site. On some I see their primary goal of
            showing off their page and their character but then it is alongside a political movement too. I don't want this to be biased in any 
            way, and that includes any current events. No wars, political parties, if Nintendo is doing poorly in the buisness world the site will 
            remain the same. It is dedicated to the games that people love and will continue to point out any cool facts about them.
