            <h2>Website Summary:</h2>
            <p>Contains a bit of info on Mario his games, merchandise, and other cool things. Like the characters and their height, age, and creation. Popular games which will then go into a sub category of secrets in those games or easter eggs. World records. Merchandise for figurines and some of the rare ones too that would be worth a lot at an auction. Anything and everything really</p>
            <h4>What content will the site contain?</h4>
            <p>Info on characters. Videos showing secrets in the games. Small concspiracy theories that are more jokes than anything (like Peach is cheating with bowser or some other trolly thing). Where to find rare merchandise</p>
            <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?</h4>
            <p>Youtuberes will "help" me make videos for this game and then be properly credited, any deep dives into the game. I will also look up expensive figurines to show how much some people invest into it, and more affordable options like a designed switch.</p>
            <h4>Why should users care about the focus of the site?</h4>
            <p>More or less want it to be a collective knowledge that just pops up when someone searches "Mario Secrets", and show them how much there could be</p>
            <h4>Why should a site be built for this?</h4>
            <p>No real reason on why a site like this needs to exist. It is just for people to have fun with</p>
            <h4>What would you like users to do at your site?</h4>
            <p>Hopefully it would link out to artist or other creators for visitors to buy from, but also still just a fun thing.</p>
            <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
            <p>Have fun, because my last site kinda sucked so hopefully this will be a little more of a refreshing topic</p>
