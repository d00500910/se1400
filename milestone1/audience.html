        <h4>Geolocation</h4>
        <p>
            Primarly targeting Americans and Japanese people, the great thing about the internet is that it connects us all despite the distance.
        </p>
        <h4>Age</h4>
        <p>
            The site will definetly be child friendly as the Mario games always have been but I expect a more mature audience, people who may 
            want to buy stuff, or support creators.
        </p>
        <h4>Gender</h4>
        <p>
            Like age, it will equally target most everyone. I expect mostly guys to come to the site though considering they get into gaming more
            than girls typically do.
