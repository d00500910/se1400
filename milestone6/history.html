            <h2>The Birth of a Legend</h2>
            <p>
                Starting in 1981, the first iteration of Mario debuted as Jumpman, a determined hero on a mission to rescue 
                his girlfriend—who would later become Princess Peach—from the clutches of Donkey Kong. Just two years later, 
                Mario was reimagined into the iconic red plumber we know today. In Mario Bros (1983), he was joined by 
                his taller, green themed brother Luigi, and together they battled creatures in New York’s underground sewers 
                a subtle hint of the games yet to come.<br><br>
                Following the success of Mario Bros, Nintendo launched a new title in 1985 Super Mario 
                Bros. This legendary game introduced Bowser and his minions, solidifying Mario’s timeless rivalry with the 
                King of the Koopas. With advancements in technology, Super Mario Bros brought smoother mechanics, vibrant 
                landscapes, and unforgettable gameplay, cementing Mario’s place as one of the greatest gaming icons of all 
                time.
            </p>
            <h2>Building The Franchise</h2>
            <p>
                Through the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, the Super Mario universe was rapidly expanding. Yoshi made his grand 
                debut, alongside an array of new power-ups, offering players new ways to solve puzzles, access 
                secret levels, and experience fresh gameplay mechanics. Mario’s presence wasn't just growing in games 
                Nintendo also approved shows like "The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!", officially launching Mario into the 
                world of entertainment, proving that his legacy extended far beyond just the gaming platforms.<br><br>

                Meanwhile, character development was also pushing forward, especially for Mario’s trusty partner, Luigi. 
                No longer just a sidekick, Luigi was stepping out of Mario’s shadow, earning his own titles that highlighted 
                his unique skills. Luigi proved he was more than just Player 2, he was a hero in his own right. With his 
                high jumping abilities, newfound ghost hunting adventures, and gameplay mechanics that distinguished him 
                from Mario, he solidified his place in the franchise as an unforgettable force in the Mushroom Kingdom.
            </p>
            <h2>Where This Game Stands Today</h2>
            <p>
                From exhilarating speedruns to laid back casual play, and from legendary platforming to unforgettable party 
                games, Mario has not only defined genres but revolutionized them. While other franchises specialize in 
                single niches, Mario has effortlessly crossed boundaries, bringing innovation to platformers, racers, 
                and multiplayer experiences alike. <br><br>

                What makes Mario truly special isn't just its gameplay, it's the community that has embraced it. Whether 
                through fan-made levels, competitive tournaments, or creative projects inspired by its legacy, the Mario 
                franchise continues to thrive in the hearts of millions. Decades after its debut, it remains a driving 
                force in the gaming world, constantly evolving, always inspiring, and forever shaping the future of play.
